# problems of coverage in synoptic data
# 
# map of what is available in time and in space
# 
# high-level interfaces to access data AND consistent and sophisticated high-level objects
# 
# - show SST map and summary, ice map and summary
# - data extraction, data merging, fusing, building models we need the following basics
# - read[sst](date)
# - extract(readsst, xytime.df)
# show application of calculating maximum ice extent
## application of investigating chl-a blooms after ice retreat
# extensibility of read function model
# extensibility of file acquistion (raadsync)
#
# Background infrastructure is the collection of files, maintained and kept up to date. 
# Access functions in R provide consistency, ease of use
