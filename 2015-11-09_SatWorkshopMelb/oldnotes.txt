R tools for satellite data

The raadtools system provides an easy to use interface to a wide range of satellite data products. There is a configuration process for a data collection which is synchronized by download from online sources, and then provided to users via a standardized read function on date-time, with other options. Many data sources work "off the shelf" since they are understood by standard tools like GDAL, others require more interpretation in the read function due to differing standards or alignment to conventions. Data are provided in high-level form with the basic geo-spatial and temporal metadata required for analyses and extraction, and there are generalized extraction routines for trajectory queries from any collection. Not all data streams come in regular longitude-latitude grids, and maintaining this original structure is a key feature of raadtools. In this talk I will present the user experience and the process of registering and synchronizing a new data source. The talk will also touch on some of the limitations encountered between the worlds of GIS and physical modelling, and how the raadtools approach can be applied to lower level data streams.
