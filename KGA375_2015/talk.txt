current role - Software Database Engineer
Australian Antarctic Division and the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems CRC

Data and programming support for Ecosystem Modelling
- current focus is on coupling ecosystem models with physical models of ocean circulation
- requires a lot of automation manipulating all kinds of spatial formats and structures
- polygons, transect lines, animal movement models, remote sensing data
- inherently 3D and 4D data structures and models
- ROMS, Atlantis, assessment

Polar regions really benefit from using map projections
- daily sea ice maps
- many hidden tricks where GIS-grids stored in dumbed down structures

Data library
- synchronization tools to build collection of remote sensing data
- R tools to read each type, simple as
- readsst(date); readice(date) etc. 

stereographic 3d plot

mesh-based bathymetry 3d plot, showing different detail levels

importance of map projections in polar use

- ice concentration on polar grid
- currents (were on Mercator, still very common)
- assessment polygons (cross dateline)
