R tools to access multi-dimensional grid data (e.g. satellite data
like SST, Chl-a, sea ice concentration, etc.). 

The discussion includes: 
- general howto and use of the tools
- the importance of map projections and some adventures in working
  around incomplete or inconsistent metadata
- building extensible tools for extracting data
- providing the tools as services in an open development environment
